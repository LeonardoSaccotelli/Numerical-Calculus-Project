# Numerical-Calculus-Project
The project aims to implement and testing in different way different numerical calculus algorithms.
Project developed during the Numerical Calculus course @ [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) @ [University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/) under the supervision of dr. [Roberto Garrappa](https://www.dm.uniba.it/members/garrappa).
